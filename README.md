# Modified-Roon-Web-Display
My modification of the [Roon web display](https://help.roonlabs.com/portal/en/kb/articles/displays).

Since (Roon Build 923), the web display has been heavily revised. I am satisfied with this solution on the whole, so I see no need for me to manually adjust the corresponding files anymore.

You can find more information on [my GitHub Pages](https://florib779.github.io/Roon/articles/roon-web-display.html).
